Dear friend, family and/or colleague,

It's my pleasure to invite you to the public defence of my doctoral dissertation titled: *"Modelling single-cell dynamics with trajectories and gene regulatory networks"*. In this work, I perform fundamental research on how cells develop using various computer programs. Unfortunately, the whole defence will be in Dutch, but my body language will be in English.

The defence will take place on Monday 16 December 2019 at 16h in the Seminar room in the FSVM research building ([Technologiepark 71, 9070 Zwijnaarde](#location)) and will be followed by a reception. 

**Please confirm your attendance before 1 December using [the form below](#register).**

Kind regards,<br/>
Robrecht
