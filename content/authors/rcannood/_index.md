Hello! I'm Robrecht Cannoodt, a researcher in Computer Science at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be) and [VIB](http://www.vib.be). I enjoy developing and contributing to data science software projects, many of which are on my [Github](https://github.com/rcannood) page.

My work mostly involves developing open-source R packages, and can be largely split up in two categories: tools for analysing single-cell omics data ([dyngen](https://github.com/dynverse/dyngen), [dyno](https://github.com/dynverse/dyno), [SCORPIUS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SCORPIUS)), and general-purpose data mining algorithms ([lmds](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lmds), [GillespieSSA2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GillespieSSA2), [gng](https://github.com/rcannood/gng), [princurve](https://cran.r-project.org/package=princurve)). 
For each of these packages, I aim to automate execution of unit tests and write extensive documentation to ensure the functionality provided by my code works as intended.
Check out the [Software](software/) page for more information on each of these packages.
