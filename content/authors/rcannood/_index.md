Hello! I'm Robrecht Cannoodt, a researcher in Computer Science at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be) and [VIB](http://www.vib.be).
I am currently in the last steps of wrapping up my PhD, for which I am expected to graduate in December 2019.

I enjoy developing and contributing to data science software projects (See [Software](software)). In particular, I enjoy developing or speeding up algorithms; adding functionality to existing software; and contributing to open-source projects. During my PhD, I developed tools for analysing [single-cell omics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_cell_sequencing) data, but many of these software packages can be used for general-purpose data mining applications.
