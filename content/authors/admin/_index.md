Hello! I'm Robrecht Cannoodt, a researcher in Computer Science at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be) and [VIB](http://www.vib.be). I enjoy developing and contributing to data science software projects, many of which are on my [Github](https://github.com/rcannood) page.

My work mostly involves developing open-source R packages, and can be largely split up in two categories: tools for analysing single-cell omics data ([dyngen](https://github.com/dynverse/dyngen), [dyno](https://github.com/dynverse/dyno), [SCORPIUS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SCORPIUS)), and general-purpose data mining algorithms ([lmds](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lmds), [GillespieSSA2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GillespieSSA2), [gng](https://github.com/rcannood/gng), [princurve](https://cran.r-project.org/package=princurve)). 
For each of these packages, I aim to automate execution of unit tests and write extensive documentation to ensure the functionality provided by my code works as intended.

In addition, I also help maintain or extend other packages on Github, CRAN or Bioconductor on which I often depend. This includes speeding up algorithms ([slingshot](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/slingshot)), implementing new functionality ([ParamHelpers](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ParamHelpers), [ranger](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ranger), [rlang](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rlang)), fixing bugs ([devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools), [proxyC](https://cran.r-project.org/package=proxyC), [monocle](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/monocle), [shadowtext](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shadowtext)), maintaining orphaned packages ([diffusionMap](https://cran.r-project.org/package=diffusionMap), [princurve](https://cran.r-project.org/package=princurve), [GillespieSSA](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GillespieSSA)), extending documentation ([devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools), [mlr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mlr), [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes)), and fixing issues with continuous integration systems ([Rdimtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rdimtools), [slingshot](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/slingshot), [monocle](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/monocle), [splatter](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/splatter)).
